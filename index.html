                            Pandas are a symbol of strength, peace, good luck, positive outlook
                            on life and connection with eastern wisdom.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                          Like Pandas, Credo are powerful, inspiring with strength and
                          determination in steadiness in our endeavours.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                          The black and white markings of the Panda gives it an association
                          with a harmony of yin and yang  - the calm demeanor of this
                          creature strengthens that symbolism along with the meaning of "peace".
                          At Credo we are black and white with no shades of grey.
